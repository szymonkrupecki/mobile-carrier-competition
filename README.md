# Megaline Plan Recommendation

This project aims to develop a classification model for Megaline, a mobile carrier, to recommend their newer plans—Smart or Ultra—based on subscribers' monthly behavior data. Using historical data on call volume, internet usage, and messaging, the model predicts the most suitable plan for users transitioning from legacy plans.

## Key Features

- **Data**: Preprocessed dataset with user behavior metrics and current plan labels.
- **Objective**: Build a model to accurately classify subscribers into Smart or Ultra plans.
- **Evaluation**: Models are evaluated based on accuracy with a target threshold of 0.75.
